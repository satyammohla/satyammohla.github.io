URA03 : for Dual Degree Level Research Project. If the committee evaluating the Final Stage of the Dual Degree Project of a given Dual Degree student believes that the student has carried out truly exceptional work and the quantum of work is substantially higher than what is expected, it may recommend that two more faculty members, other than those who already participated in the committee for evaluation, duly chosen by the DUGC, examine the work done and evaluate whether a URA03 can be awarded to the student in addition to the AA grade already given. A joint recommendation must then be made by all: the original committee of evaluation and these two other faculty members that this student be awarded URA03, duly routed through the Convener, DUGC to the Convener, UGAPEC. This award, on approval by the UGAPEC, will be mentioned on the grade report of the student as URA03
